This is a complete introduction into how CTF-Citadel works under the hood.

## Motivation ##

We decided to built a new platform because we weren't satisfied with what current solutions available provided out of the box. Although some other projects provide things like plugin systems, those never worked out in a way we would've liked them to, so we decided to take the matters into our own hands and start from zero.

## Frameworks and Languages ##

We settled on modern technologies and frameworks to build CTF-Citadel from the ground up including:

- [Astro.js](https://astro.build/): A modern JavaScript Meta-Framework that enables rapid developement and cutting edge features.
- [Svelte.js](https://svelte.dev/): the *better React* as we like to call it, compiles to vanilla JavaScript and is extremely efficient, compact and fast.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): CSS done right.
- [Lucia Auth](https://lucia-auth.com/): a simple and clean Authentication System that is written completely in TypeScript and works wondefully alongside Frameworks like Astro and Svelte.
