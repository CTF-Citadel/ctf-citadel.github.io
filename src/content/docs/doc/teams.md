description: Documentation for Teams

In the Team Page of CTF-Citadel, where collaboration and expertise converge to drive our mission forward. This documentation should provide you an insightful overview of the individual ideas which we had while creating this page.

## Team Creation and more ##

The selection of an team will play a crucial role in the overall success of our Anti-Cheat System. By Creating a team that specific team will be provided by an Team UID, which will then be used in our challenge deployement. Those UID's will play an important part in generating the flags for the team searching for it. By doing this we achieve some kind of Anti-Cheat, by denying users Flag-Sharing during our CTF.

## Team Selection ##

If user want to join an team, they will need to provide an generated code which the "Team-Creator" will be able to see after the creation was complete. The team leader will be able to adjust the team settings. Team size and Event Category will be decided by our System and is fixated and will not be changeable.
