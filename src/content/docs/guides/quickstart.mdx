Hosting your own CTF can be quite tricky, but we want to change that!

Below you will find all the necessary steps to get your own instance of CTF-Citadel up and running in no time!

## Web-App Initial Setup

We can start off by cloning the main WebApp Repository

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/CTF-Citadel/webapp
# change into the examples folder
cd webapp/examples/
```

Great, now we have everything we need to get started!

The examples subdirectory contains config files for NGINX, as well as a dedicated subfolder for SSL-Certificates, which is `nginx/ssl/`.

You may put two files in here named `server.crt` and `server.key` respectably, which is you Public Certificate and Private Key.

:::note
Although not advised, you can generate self-signed certificates with this neat one-liner:
```bash
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.crt
```
:::

Self-signed certificates are not recommended, you should of course have some valid domain to register officially signed SSL-Certificates.
Although when deploying the platform locally, inaccessible to the outside world, self-signed Certificates may be sufficient.

### Deploy Using Docker

We made hosting your own instance of CTF-Citadel really easy to accoplish using the power of Docker.

Fresh Images of our WebApp are built on every push to `master` and can be pulled from here:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/ctf-citadel/webapp:main
```

An way easier method is to use our `docker-compose.yaml` file already present in the repo.

This automatically pulls prebuilt images from their respective container registries and should get you up and running in no time.

Before that, it may be a good thing to customize some things for your needs, which is described below.

### What to change ###

The file might look a bit overwhelming at first so here is a walkthrough on what you will need to change.

### Bind Mounts ###

- `./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`: This is a bind mount to the configuration files for the NGINX reverse proxy. This path should not need changing as long as you do not change the file location of the `docker-compose.yaml`. You can navigate to `proxy/` from the repo root and examine the provided config file. If desired you can use a different proxy or integrate it into an already exisiting one.
- `./nginx/ssl:/etc/ssl/private`: This is the bind mount to your SSL Certificates that NGINX will use to secure your traffic over HTTPS. If you examined the config file you might have noticed that it will always look for `server.crt` and `server.key`. You should either name your certfiles accordingly or modify the paths in the config file mentioned above.
- `./data/postgres:/var/lib/mysql`: This is where your database stores data, which is user data, challenges, ongoing events and more. Choose this path wisely as it is where your data will reside!

### General Variables

- `EMAIL_NAME`: This is the E-Mail that will be used for Verification and Password Reset E-Mails for Users.
- `EMAIL_PASS`: Password for the E-Mail Account that you specified above.
- `EMAIL_SERVICE`: This is the service specifier that will vary depending on what email provider you use. The default is `hotmail`, which works for Microsoft E-Mails.
- `DB_*`: These are database parameters and should match the ones that you define for the PostgreSQL container itself. We won't got into more detail on each of them as they are pretty self-explanatory
- `INFRA_*`: These are infra parameters for the infra component, which should point to the host that your container infra runs on. We won't got into more detail on each of them as they are pretty self-explanatory
- `M0N1T0R_*`: Parameters for configurion `m0n1t0r`, the Anti-Cheat component of CTF-Citadel
- `F1RSTBL00D_*`: Parameters for configurion `f1rstbl00d`, the Discord Firstblood Bot of CTF-Citadel

### Platform Specific Variables

- `INSTANCE_NAME`: Official name of the CTF event or hosters
- `DATA_FOLDER`: Data folder that the webapp has access to for providing certificate pdf's and flag pools - should match the `docker-compose` or be left default.
- `SCORING_K`: The K parameter for the dynamic scoring component, higher value mean less aggressive point degradation with more solves and vice-versa.
- `DISABLE_EMAIL_VERIFY`: Disable the verification process at initial user signup - `0 == false` and `1 == true` 
- `ENFORCE_EMAIL_DOMAIN`: Specify if the webapp should enforce email domains at signup - `0 == false` and `1 == true`
- `ENFORCE_DOMAIN`: Specify the email domain that the webapp should enfore - ignored if not enabled.
- `DISCORD_URL`: URL to the public Discord of the event, will be available through the `/rules` page.

### Starting the Containers

Once you are happy with your changes, there is only one thing left to do:

```bash
docker-compose --profile full up -d
```

This will pull and start all containers and if you go to `https://localhost:443/`, you should see the Login Page show up.

:::note
Keep in mind that the first user to sign-up on a newly created instance will automatically be assigned the administrator role!
:::

### Understanding Profiles

The `docker-compose.yaml` file in examples is structured and managed using docker profiles. This allows you to omit certain components of the whole Citadel stack, if desired.

There are currently three profiles available.

- `full`: Deploy the stack using all components, including Anti-Cheat, Discord Bot and WebApp
- `standalone`: Deploy only the WebApp component, excluding Anti-Cheat and Discord Bot
- `anticheat`: Deploy the WebApp, including only the Anti-Cheat Component
- `firstblood`: Deploy the WebApp, including only the Discord Bot Component

To start a different profile, just switch the command already shown above, for example to use `standalone` mode you can run the following.

```bash
docker-compose --profile standalone up -d
```

By utilizing different profiles, different environment variables will come into effect, so be sure you configured them correctly.

### Manual Building of the WebApp

If you want to test the latest bleeding-edge changes directly from `main` or maybe incorporate some changes of your own, you will need to build a new Docker images locally.

Doing that is pretty easy and can be done by modifying the `docker-compose.yaml` in the examples folder.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  # ...
  # You can leave the nginx and postgres containers identical
  # ...
  webapp:
    build:                    # <- changing from image to build
      context: ${PWD}/../     # <- specify our project root
      dockerfile: Dockerfile  # <- name of the Dockerfile to build from
  # ...
  # Rest is the same
  # ...
```

:::caution
Do make sure that you are in the correct folder, so Docker can actually find and build from the project root.

If you were to place the `docker-compose.yaml` in the repository root, you could set `context: .`, but keep in mind that this will require you to change the bind mounts.
Because the nginx configuration files are located in the `examples/` directory.
:::

If you did the above correctly you should now be able to build your own image, telling Docker to do so.

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This should build the Astro WebApp directly from source and start the other containers automatically.

## Infra-Backend Initial Setup

Start by copying the `tophack-stack.yml` file from the sample folder in the infra-middleware [repo](https://github.com/CTF-Citadel/infra-middleware/tree/main) to your server.

Then, you can follow these steps to deploy the backend:

### Setup Docker Swarm Production Environment

This setup requires a Linux machine with Docker installed.

#### Initialize Cluster:
```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER-IP>
```
This will return something like:
```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.99.100
Swarm initialized: current node (dxn1zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngz) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join \
    --token SWMTKN-1-49nj1cmql0jkz5s954yi3oex3nedyz0fb0xx14ie39trti4wxv-8vxv8rssmk743ojnwacrr2e7c \
    192.168.99.100:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
```

As the output suggests, you need to run the `docker swarm join --token <TOKEN>` command on each node.

### Setup Traefik in Newly Created Swarm

```bash
docker network create --driver=overlay --subnet=10.1.0.0/16 traefik-public
```

```bash
export NODE_ID=$(docker info -f '{{.Swarm.NodeID}}')
```

```bash
docker node update --label-add traefik-public.traefik-public-certificates=true $NODE_ID
```

```bash
# Environment variables for the entire CTF Citadel backend, excluding the webapp
export EMAIL=admin@tophack.org # Email for certbot
export DOMAIN=traefik.cluster.tophack.org # Domain for Traefik
export CONTROLLER_DOMAIN=cluster.tophack.org # Domain for controller containers
export USERNAME=admin # Username for Portainer
export PASSWORD=super_secret_portainer_password # Password for Portainer
export HASHED_PASSWORD=$(openssl passwd -apr1 $PASSWORD) # Hashed password for Portainer
export CF_API_EMAIL=mymail@cloudflare.com # Email of Cloudflare account owning the domain for DNS challenge
export CF_API_KEY=my-cf-api-key # API key of Cloudflare account owning the domain for DNS challenge
export GITHUB_USERNAME=ctf-citadel # Username of the GitHub account owning the challenge repository
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_supersecret # Personal access token of the GitHub account owning the challenge repository
export DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=dockerhubuser # Username for Dockerhub, used to push images during the event
export DOCKERHUB_TOKEN=dckr_pat_supersecret # Personal access token for Dockerhub, used to push images during the event
export PSK=super_secret_key # Pre-shared key to authenticate web-backend
export CONTROLLER_REPLICACOUNT=1 # Count of replicas for controller container. This also specifies the number of images that can be built simultaneously.
```

```bash
docker login -u $GITHUB_USERNAME -p $GITHUB_TOKEN ghcr.io
```

Login to ghcr.io for the controller image:

```bash
docker stack deploy -c tophack-stack.yml tophack-stack
```

This deploys Traefik and the infra-middleware controller to the Swarm cluster with your environment variables.
