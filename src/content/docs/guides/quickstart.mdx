Hosting your own CTF can be quite tricky, but we want to change that!

Below you will find all the necessary steps to get your own instance of CTF-Citadel up and running in no time!

## Aquiring the Code ##

We can start off by cloning the main WebApp Repository

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/CTF-Citadel/webapp
# change into the new folder
cd webapp/
```

Great, now we have everything we need to get started!

Although some examples below dont strictly need to build from source, the repo also contains config files for the database and the reverse proxy that handles SSL.

## Deploy Using Docker ##

We made hosting your own instance of CTF-Citadel really easy to accoplish using the power of Docker.

Fresh Images of our WebApp are built on every push to `master` and can be pulled from here:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/ctf-citadel/webapp:main
```

An way easier method is to use our `docker-compose.yaml` file already present in the repo.

Keep in mind that this file is setup to build the web container from source, which presents and excellent opportunity in case you want to tweak something in the source code yourself.

Alternatively, you can use a slightly modified version of the developement Compose file.
This pulls the prebuilt image mentioned above directly from our GitHub Container Registry:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  proxy:
    image: nginx:latest
    hostname: proxy
    ports:
      - '80:80'
      - '443:443'
    volumes:
      - ./proxy/conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d
      - ./proxy/ssl:/etc/ssl/private
    environment:
      TZ: Europe/Vienna
    restart: unless-stopped
  postgres:
    image: postgres:latest
    hostname: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: 'root'
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 'CHANGEME'
      POSTGRES_DB: 'citadel'
      TZ: Europe/Vienna
    volumes:
      - ./data/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    restart: unless-stopped
    profiles:
      - full
  astro:
    image: ghcr.io/ctf-citadel/webapp:main
    hostname: astro
    environment:
      INSTANCE_NAME: 'testCTF'
      EMAIL_SERVICE: 'hotmail'
      EMAIL_NAME: 'someone@example.com'
      EMAIL_PASS: 'CHANGEME'
      DB_HOST: 'postgres'
      DB_NAME: 'citadel'
      DB_USER: 'root'
      DB_PASS: 'CHANGEME'
      BACKEND_HOST: '127.0.0.1'
      BACKEND_PORT: 8080
      TZ: Europe/Vienna
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### What to change ###

The file might look a bit overwhelming at first so here is a walkthrough on what you will need to change.

### Bind Mounts ###

- `./proxy/conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d`: This is a bind mount to the configuration files for the NGINX reverse proxy. This path should not need changing as long as you do not change the file location of the `docker-compose.yaml`. You can navigate to `proxy/` from the repo root and examine the provided config file. If desired you can use a different proxy or integrate it into an already exisiting one.
- `./proxy/conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d`: This is the bind mount to your SSL Certificates that NGINX will use to secure your traffic over HTTPS. If you examined the config file you might have noticed that it will always look for `server.crt` and `server.key`. You should either name your certfiles accordingly or modify the paths in the config file mentioned above.
- `./data/postgres:/var/lib/mysql`: This is where your database stores data, which is user data, challenges, ongoing events and more. Choose this path wisely as it is where your data will reside!

:::note
Although not advised, you can generate self-signed certificates with this neat one-liner:
```bash
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.crt
```
:::

### Environment Variables ###

- `EMAIL_NAME`: This is the E-Mail that will be used for Verification and Password Reset E-Mails for Users.
- `EMAIL_PASS`: Password for the E-Mail Account that you specified above.
- `EMAIL_SERVICE`: This is the service specifier that will vary depending on what email provider you use. The default is `hotmail`, which works for Microsoft E-Mails.
- `DB_*`: These are database parameters and should match the ones that you define for the PostgreSQL container itself. We won't got into more detail on each of them as they are pretty self-explanatory
- `BACKEND_*`: These are backend parameters for the infra component, which should point to the host that your container infra runs on. We won't got into more detail on each of them as they are pretty self-explanatory

Once you are happy with your changes, there is only one thing left to do:

**With the original from-source Compose File:**

```bash
docker-compose --profile full up -d --build
```

**With the modified pre-built Compose File:**

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start (and build) all containers and if you go to `https://localhost:443/`, you should see the Login Page show up.

:::note
Keep in mind that the first user to sign-up on a newly created instance will automatically be assigned the administrator role!

## Deploying for Development ##

For tinkering with the Platform itself, one may want to spin up the other profile in the provided `docker-compose.yaml`, to spin up a standalone PostgreSQL instance.

```bash
docker-compose --profile dev up -d --build
```

This database will then listen on `localhost:5432`, and can be accessed by starting the WebApp in development mode from the project root.

Be aware that the application still needs all the environment variables, which are otherwise provided by the `docker-compose.yaml` file. This can be done on Linux based systems like so:

```bash
INSTANCE_NAME='testCTF' \
EMAIL_SERVICE='hotmail' \
EMAIL_NAME='some@example.com' \
EMAIL_PASS='CHANGEME' \
DB_HOST='127.0.0.1' \
DB_NAME='citadel' \
DB_USER='root' \
DB_PASS='CHANGEME' \
BACKEND_HOST='127.0.0.1' \
BACKEND_PORT=8080 \
npm run dev
```

Or, if you are developing on a Windows based system like so:

```powershell
$env:INSTANCE_NAME="testCTF"
$env:EMAIL_SERVICE="hotmail"
$env:EMAIL_NAME='some@example.com' 
$env:EMAIL_PASS='CHANGEME'
$env:DB_HOST='127.0.0.1'
$env:DB_NAME='citadel'
$env:DB_USER='root'
$env:DB_PASS="CHANGEME"
$env:BACKEND_HOST="127.0.0.1" 
$env:BACKEND_PORT="8080"
npm run dev
```

This will start the Web Application in Astro's development mode. Since we check for this in the Authentication events, you will be able to interact, without actually logging in, since you are currently in a "Dummy Session".

```ts
// index.astro
import { DUMMY_SESSION } from '../lib/helpers';
// ...
let session = DUMMY_SESSION;

if (!import.meta.env.DEV) {
    // ...
    session = { ...Astro.locals.user };
}

<Layout title="CTF-Citadel">
    <Header
        username={session.username}
        interactive={true}
        admin={session.user_role == 'admin' ? true : false}
        client:visible
    />
    // ...
</Layout>
// ...
```

This allows you to tinker the platform more easily and adapt it to your needs. It will also automatically assign you the administrator `user_role`.
