**Welcome to the CTF-Citadel documentation!**

Here you can find all the information you need to get started with CTF-Citadel. If you have any questions, feel free to open up an discussion on our [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/CTF-Citadel/discussions) or, if you have found a bug, open up an issue in the corresponding [GitHub repository](https://github.com/orgs/CTF-Citadel/repositories).

## What is CTF-Citadel?

CTF-Citadel is a CTF platform that is designed to be easy to use, and easy to deploy. It is built with the following principles in mind:

-   **Easy to use**: CTF-Citadel is designed to be easy to use, both for players and for admins. It is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate.
-   **Easy to deploy**: CTF-Citadel is designed to be easy to deploy.
-   **Secure**: CTF-Citadel is designed to be secure. It is built with security in mind, and is designed to be secure by default.
-   **Anti-Cheat**: CTF-Citadel has a built-in anti-cheat system that is designed to prevent cheating.

We are developing this platform as a part of a school project called [TopHack](https://tophack.at/). TopHack is the internal annual CTF of the [HTL Villach](https://www.htl-villach.at/). The goal of TopHack is to teach students about cyber security, pentesting and red teaming.

## Why use CTF-Citadel?

There are many CTF platforms out there, with CTFd being the most popular. But CTFd has certain limitations _(in the free version at least)_. We are aiming to fill these gaps with CTF-Citadel.

It is important to note, that we are not developing a plugin for CTFd. We are developing a completely new platform, from scratch. This allows us to build a platform that is exactly what we want it to be, without having to work around the limitations of CTFd.

So lets take a look at some of the features that CTF-Citadel has, and CTFd does not.

| Features                         | CTFd                                                     | CTF-Citadel                                              |
