# About the Project

With [CTFd]() being the most used platform for hosting CTF Challenges, we wanted to create a modern alternative using the latest frameworks and technologies.
The main goal being to combat an aspect of CTF challenges that has plagued teams and players.

## How we want to prevent Flagsharing

Our platform aims to provided a built in Anti-Cheat solution, which regularly checks submissions made my teams and users during an event.

This allows us to catch attempts at cheating such as:

-   double or multi submissions
-   little time difference in between flag submissions

In general it is recommended to use so called "UUID-Flags" for Challenges, which in simple terms is just a flag that is only valid once by nature.

Of course, not every challenge can employ such one-time-use flags, for example most OSINT-Challenges rely on flag parameters such as map coordinates or a specific location.
These are obviously static and not dynamic, so the submitted flag can also not be made dynamic.

This is exactly where the Anit-Cheat system comes into play.

CTF-Citadel is being developed as the initial project hosted under this collective, which aims to be continuously improved by classes to come, as part of the Software Development, Network Engineering and Project Management classes.

The current project team hopes to be able to continue working on this platform in the future, but we depend on other students and external contributors to continue what we have started.

## Open Source Statement

CTF-Citadel plans to always be open to the public, because we believe in the power of Open Source Software.
